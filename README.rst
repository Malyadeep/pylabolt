|Documentation status|

PyLaBolt is a single phase, 2D, parallel lattice Boltzmann solver for fluid flow. It uses 
`Numba <https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ accelerated `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ code
to run lattice Boltzmann simulations on 2D lattices. Simulations can be run on CPU in parallel via 
Numba's own `OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org/>`_ parallelization and the `mpi4py <https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ library.
For running on NVIDIA GPUs, PyLaBolt uses Numba's `CUDA <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit>`_ bindings.

=======================
Installation and Usage
=======================
PyLaBolt can be installed via ``pip`` via the command::

    $ pip install pylabolt

More details on the dependencies and their configuration can be found
in the PyLaBolt documentation `here <https://PyLaBolt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Tutorial cases are provided in the ``tutorials`` folder. For example, consider the lid driven cavity
problem in ``tutorials/cavity/Re_100/``. The configuration file that defines the simulation is 
called ``simulation.py``. After installation just run the following command from the ``tutorials/cavity/Re_100/``
folder::

    $ pylabolt --solver fluidLB

The output data is written in the ``output`` folder. By default the data is written into binary files with 
``.dat`` extension. To visualize the data in `Paraview <https://www.paraview.org/>`_ / 
`Mayavi <https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/>`_, the `VTK <https://vtk.org/>`_ library is used.
For example, to convert the last time-step data to a ``.vtk`` file, run the following command from
the working directory::

    $ pylabolt --toVTK last

The ``output_<time-step>.vtk`` files are stored in ``output/VTK`` directory which can be opened in
Paraview/Mayavi. Sample results for lid driven cavity, plane Poiseuille flow, and flow past a cylinder are shown below.

Features
=======================
PyLaBolt currently supports the following collision schemes

- Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) scheme - `Physical Review, vol. 94, Issue 3, pp. 511-525 
  <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/1954PhRv...94..511B/doi:10.1103/PhysRev.94.511>`_
- Multiple Relaxation Time (MRT) scheme - `Multiple relaxation time lattice Boltzmann models in three dimensions 
  <https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2001.0955>`_

It also supports the `Guo's forcing scheme <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.65.046308>_` for force-driven 
flows.

PyLaBolt leverages the performance advantages on multi-core CPUs, High Perfomance computing clusters, and
GPUs to run large simulations. Currently the parallel computing features supported by PyLaBolt are:

- `Numba <https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ accelerated `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ code can
  run in parallel on multi-core CPUs through `OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org/>`_.
- To run on multiple machines/clusters, PyLaBolt uses `OpenMPI <https://www.open-mpi.org/>`_ via the `mpi4py <https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_
  library.
- PyLaBolt can also run simulations on NVIDIA GPUs through Numba's `CUDA <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit>`_ bindings.
- PyLaBolt provides support to convert output to `VTK <https://vtk.org/>`_ format, which can post-processed in Paraview/Mayavi.
